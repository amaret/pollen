This is the testable grammar version. 
It requires certain options in antlr
(ASTLabelType, TokenLabelType)
to have their default values or it will 
not work. The generated AntlrWorks code
has dependencies. 

Therefore it has to be maintained
separately from the production grammar.

It is useful for checking new 
features in the grammar.

Correct 'expected' test output is 
not implemented, just grep output 
against the master file.

The directory 'AntlrWorks workspace'
is the development dir for this 
grammar version. 

use runt or runt_all for running tests.
the parameter 'new' will create a new
testable grammar from the pollen.g
in directory 'AntlrWorks workspace'.
